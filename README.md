# Curve-Fitting-using-Least-Squares-Approximation

In this jupyter notebook I will try to write a class that generalizes the least squares approximation to a certain degree of percision. This will help ensure that with any sets of data, the least squares approximation is easily avaliable rather than having to calculate it out for each dataset and each degree of polynomial. In addition, using the general least squares approximation class I created I will try to perform cruve fitting on the NYC population and water consumption dataset I gathered from NYC Open Data.
